        <p>Hi there. They call me Leroy, Mr. Buliro, but I also go by LERB. I am a full time financial advisor, part-time deejay, and occasional...well, you guessed it, storytelling enthusiast. Welcome to my personal website, a place for me to log snapshots of my life over the years, share stories as told by others, and periodically post technical content that may interest a couple other people.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: large;">Story of LERB</p>
        <p>LERB is a Nairobi-based DJ who first emerged from the limelight after winning the 2nd runners-up spot during Nairobi's Battle of the DJs, in 2016. His selection of music caught the ears of the panel of judges, notably, members of Bad Mambo, Umojah Sound System, & Sub Conscious, and ended up joining all three crews. Since then, he has serenaded the stages of various underground gigs and International music festivals, championing East Africaâ€™s sound system culture, and serving bass grooves show after show.</P>
        <br>
